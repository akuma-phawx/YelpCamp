## YelpCamp__

Live example coming soon

Code along project with Colt Steele from The Complete Web Development Bootcamp @Udemy.

All the knowledge and technologies that have been learned throughout the course will be used in this massive project in order to practise and gain experience.

HTML, CSS, Modern JS, Node, Express MongoDB, Bootstrap, Application Deployment and Security, Authentication and many more topic are covered in this project.

The idea behind of YelpCamp is to be able to search and view campgrounds, review them and add more of them.
